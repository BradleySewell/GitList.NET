      <p>A Git tool built to easily manage (change branch, fetch, reset etc.) multiple git repositories at the same time, provided that they are in the same root folder. This is really handy for setting all of your repositories to a specific branch with the click of a button.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Also manage individual repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>Add multiple root directories and it will auto discover all the repositories contained within and group them together. </p></li>
<li><p>A good overview of each repository, displays what branch they are on and how many commits ahead or behind and how many changes have been made.</p></li>
<li><p>Each repository has its own git terminal for added flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto refresh, periodic refresh, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
